## Possible Research Topics

The two main factors affect the final price of Uber and Lyft in Boston.

## Smart Questions

- Is there any relationship between price and hour?
- Is there any other factors to affect the final price of Uber and Lyft?
- Do the weather factors, like temperature, wind, and sunset affect the final price?

## Processes

1. Create a GitHub Repository;
2. Confirm an appropriate topic;
   - Understand the project purpose
   - Seek for a potential dataset/database/data sheet
   - Confirm the topic based on the dataset
3. Confirm the whole project processes;
4. Make a clear plan and timeline;
5. Prepare the first draft and slides;
6. Make a summary and final modification.

## Possible Data

The data is from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma/data). The data is about Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston, MA. This is a very beginner-friendly dataset. It does contain a lot of NA values. It is a good dataset if you want to use a Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predectors such as `hour` and `price`.

A really amazing part of this dataset is that I have included the corresponding `weather data` for that `hour` with a short summary of the `weather`. Other important factors are `temperature`, `wind`, and `sunset`.

The original data can be available on the [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma/data).
